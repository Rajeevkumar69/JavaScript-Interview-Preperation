      Q3. Design a prototype for an Animal with a method `speak()`. Create
      specific animal objects (dog, cat, bird) that inherit from the Animal
      prototype and override the `speak()` method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q4. Create a prototype for a Shape with a method `calculateArea()`.
      Implement specific shapes (circle, rectangle, square) that inherit from
      the Shape prototype and provide their own `calculateArea()` methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q5. Develop a prototype for a Gadget with properties `name` and `brand`,
      and a method `turnOn()`. Create specific gadgets (phone, laptop, tablet)
      that inherit from the Gadget prototype and override the `turnOn()` method.
    </p>

      Q6.Implement a prototype for a Tool with a method `use()`. Create specific
      tools (hammer, screwdriver, wrench) that inherit from the Tool prototype
      and provide their own `use()` methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q7.Create a prototype for a Book with properties `title` and `author`, and
      a method `describe()`. Create instances of Book and extend the prototype
      to include a method `borrow()`.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q8.Design a prototype for a Game with a method `start()`. Implement
      specific games (chess, poker, soccer) that inherit from the Game prototype
      and override the `start()` method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q9. Develop a prototype for an Appliance with properties `name` and
      `power`, and a method `operate()`. Create specific appliances (washer,
      dryer, microwave) that inherit from the Appliance prototype and provide
      their own `operate()` methods.
    </p>

    <p>
